Description:
The purpose of this program is to simulate a simple CPU Scheduler that
uses multiple scheduling algorithms. 

The original package contains the first program I wrote for my operating
systems class. mfarme2_cpu_scheduler.java is my first attempt at the 
simulator; although it works fine, it is pretty basic and admittedly 
pretty sloppy.
